## Project Description
Chronic liver disease poses significant global health challenges, often advancing unnoticed until severe stages. By using machine learning models, this project aims to predict the presence and progression of liver disease based on patient data, enabling early diagnosis and intervention.


### Key Features
- **Dataset**: The project uses the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset).
- **Algorithms**: Techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble Learning (Stacking and ExtraTrees) were applied to achieve high accuracy and robustness.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes label encoding, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to prepare the dataset for machine learning.
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning through Bayesian Optimization was performed to enhance model performance.

### Performance
The best-performing model in the study was the **Bayesian Optimized ExtraTrees Classifier**, achieving:
- **Accuracy**: 97.3%
- **Precision**: 98.31%
- **Recall**: 96.5%
- **ROC-AUC**: 99.7%
